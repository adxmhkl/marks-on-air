This is my final year project masterpiece. It doesn't look like much but it's a sentimental value for me. Please don't use it with wrong intention :D.

This repo contains 3 files, zipped source code and db files.
Unzip the zip file, all the source code are stored inside it.
In order for this system to work, it needs the database side as well, so run the sql file (either one of those 2).
The different between the two sql files is just that the raw one only contains the table structure, while the dummy one contains both table structure and dummy data for test run.
Execute the sql commands in any of your dbms, then link your db with the source code by configuring dbconfig.php file.
I guess that's all I can briefly explain here.
If there's anything, you may ping me at my email adamhaikal177@outlook.com.

:D :D :D
